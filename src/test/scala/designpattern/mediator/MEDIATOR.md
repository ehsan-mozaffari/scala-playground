## Mediator pattern

the mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.  
With the mediator pattern, communication between objects is encapsulated within a mediator object. Objects no longer communicate directly with each other, but instead communicate through the mediator. This reduces the dependencies between communicating objects, thereby reducing coupling
